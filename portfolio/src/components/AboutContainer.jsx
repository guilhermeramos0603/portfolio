        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>With 4 years in technology area, and specifically 2 years with web development. I've worked on technical projects at various levels, from the financial market to the legal market, and I have experience in a wide range.
            I seek to use new technologies on the market to create software with high scalability and low production cost, prioritizing the good user experience.

            Because I have the ability to fit in and understand the scope of projects, I have already acted as a team leader, organizing and planning the architecture of projects and separating tasks for other developers.</p>
